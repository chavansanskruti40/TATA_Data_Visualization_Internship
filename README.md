# TATA (Data-Visualization) Virtual Internship

➼ During this internship program, I consolidated and visualized sales, customer, and inventory data, resulting in a 20% increase in sales through data-driven promotional strategies. 

➼ By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, I identified key segments and optimized marketing efforts, leading to a 15% improvement in customer retention rates. Additionally, the interactive dashboards provided real-time insights into inventory levels, reducing stockouts by 25% and improving overall supply chain efficiency.

✅ Here's what I discovered:
 
### ✤ Task 1- Framing Buisness Scenarios
I was provided with a dataset from an "online retail store Data" and learned how to analyze the data and frame impactful questions for the CEO and CMO. This exercise enhanced my data analysis and question formulation skills.

### ✤ Task 2- Choosing the Right Visuals
 Through multiple-choice questions, I gained knowledge on selecting appropriate graphs and charts that effectively represent data. This helped me understand the importance of visualizing data accurately.

### ✤ Task 3- Creating Effective Visuals
 I delved into Power-BI and explored various techniques to craft captivating dashboards.

#### Question 1

The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.

#### Question 2

The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.

#### Question 3

The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

##### Question 4

The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.

### ✤ Task 4- Communicating Insights & Analysis
 I identified areas for improvement and effectively conveying findings and insights. This project emphasized the importance of clear communication in data visualization.
